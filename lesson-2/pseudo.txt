1. function that returns the sums of two numbers

START

# Given two input numbers "number1" and "number2"

PRINT number1 + number2

END

------------------------

2. function that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all
those strings concatenated

START

# Given a collection of strings called "strings"

SET result = strings in "strings" joined, separated with no characters

PRINT result

END

------------------------

3. function that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every
other element

START

# Given a collection of integers called "numbers"

SET iterator = 1
SET everyOther = empty collection (this will be returned at end)

WHILE iterator <= length of numbers
  IF iterator is odd
    SET currentNumber = value within numbers collection at space "iterator"
    push currentNumber to everyOther
  ELSE
    skip to the next iteration

  iterator = iterator + 1

PRINT everyOther

END
